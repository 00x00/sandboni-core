Feature: Feature Lorem Ipsum
  Description:
  * Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
  * Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
  * when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
  * It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged

  Scenario: Where does it
    Given  Contrary to popular belief
    When   Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text
    Then   It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC
    And    making it over 2000 years old
    And    Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia

  @TAG-1
  Scenario: come from?
    When looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur
    Then from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature
    And  discovered the undoubtable source
    When Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
    Then of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero
    And  written in 45 BC
